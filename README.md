# About Me  

I was born in 2004 and have a strong passion for Android development. I love turning creative ideas into practical, user-friendly apps that make life easier. As a developer, I constantly learn new technologies, apply modern architectures, and write clean, maintainable code. I believe a great app should balance beautiful design with solid performance. 📱

In the short term, I aim to build and publish my own Android apps on Google Play, master Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Clean Architecture, and contribute to open-source projects to sharpen my real-world skills. 🎯

My long-term goal is to become a professional Android Developer who creates impactful products, mentors others, and works in a team that values creativity, innovation, and user experience. 🌍

I value simplicity, collaboration, responsibility, and curiosity — because great apps come from learning, teamwork, and passion for growth. 🧠

I aspire to contribute to meaningful projects, share knowledge, and build products that make everyday life smarter and more connected. 🤝🍀
